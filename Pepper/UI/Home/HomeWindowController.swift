/// menu-bar app whose only thing on screen at launch was the webcam
/// preview, which left new users unsure it had opened or what to do next.
///
/// Shown at launch (after setup, the first time), on a Dock-icon click
/// with nothing open, and from the menu bar. Not at launch when the Dock
/// icon is hidden: that's the menu-bar way of using Pepper. Steps out of
/// the way while a recording starts, so it isn't in the shot, and comes
/// back if the recording is cancelled before it begins.
